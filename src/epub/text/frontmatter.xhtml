<h2>Publisher’s Note</h2>

<p>It gives us considerable pleasure to be able to offer to the public
the “inside” record of those of former District Attorney Markham’s
criminal cases in which Mr. Philo Vance figured so effectively. The
true inwardness of these famous cases has never before been revealed;
for Mr. S. S. Van Dine, Mr. Vance’s lawyer and almost constant
companion, being the only person who possessed a complete record of
the facts, has only recently been permitted to make them public.</p>

<p>After inspecting Mr. Van Dine’s voluminous notes, we decided to
publish “The Benson Murder Case” as the first of the series—not
because it was the most interesting and startling, nor yet the most
complicated and dramatic from the fictional point of view, but
because, coming first chronologically, it explains how Mr. Philo Vance
happened to become involved in criminal matters, and also because it
possesses certain features that reveal very clearly Mr. Vance’s unique
analytic methods of crime detection.</p>

<div class="section" id="introduction">

<h2>Introductory</h2>

<p>If you will refer to the municipal statistics of the City of New
York, you will find that the number of unsolved major crimes during
the four years that John F.-X. Markham was District Attorney, was far
smaller than under any of his predecessors’ administrations. Markham
projected the District Attorney’s office into all manner of criminal
investigations; and, as a result, many abstruse crimes on which the
Police had hopelessly gone aground, were eventually disposed of.</p>

<p>But although he was personally credited with the many important
indictments and subsequent convictions that he secured, the truth is
that he was only an instrument in many of his most famous cases. The
man who actually solved them and supplied the evidence for their
prosecution, was in no way connected with the city’s administration,
and never once came into the public eye.</p>

<p>At that time I happened to be both legal advisor and personal
friend of this other man; and it was thus that the strange and amazing
facts of the situation became known to me. But not until recently have
I been at liberty to make them public. Even now I am not permitted to
divulge the man’s name, and, for that reason, I have chosen,
arbitrarily, to refer to him throughout
these <i lang="la">ex-officio</i> reports as Philo Vance.</p>

<p>It is, of course, possible that some of his acquaintances may,
through my revelations, be able to guess his identity; and if such
should prove the case, I beg of them to guard that knowledge; for
though he has now gone to Italy to live, and has given me permission
to record the exploits of which he was the unique central character,
he has very emphatically imposed his anonymity upon me; and I should
not like to feel that, through any lack of discretion or delicacy, I
have been the cause of his secret becoming generally known.</p>

<p>The present chronicle has to do with Vance’s solution of the
notorious Benson murder which, due to the unexpectedness of the crime,
the prominence of the persons involved, and the startling evidence
adduced, was invested with an interest rarely surpassed in the annals
of New York’s criminal history.</p>

<p>This sensational case was the first of many in which Vance figured
as a kind of <i lang="la">amicus curiæ</i> in Markham’s
investigations.</p>
